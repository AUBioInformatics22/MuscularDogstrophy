##Overview

*Identifying the Mutation Responsible for Duchenne-Like Muscular Dystrophy in the Springer Spaniel* 

Jacqueline Barry, Cassidy Schneider, Kyndall Skelton, Rebecca Nance


## Samples
Genomic DNA was isolated from 4 affected males and 4 carrier females from the Springer Spaniel Duchenne-Like Muscular Dystrophy dog colony in Dr. Bruce F. Smith's lab at the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine. Samples were sequenced as 150bp paired-end reads using the NovaSeq 6000 platform with ~30x coverage at HudsonAlpha Discovery in Huntsville, AL.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Buddy | Affected Male | SL522590 | 0001
| Dandelion | Affected Male | SL522591 | 0002
| Camelia | Carrier Female | SL522594 | 0005
| Dottie | Carrier Female | SL522595 | 0006
