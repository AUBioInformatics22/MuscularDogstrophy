Jacqueline Barry, Cassidy Schneider, Allison Sharp, Kyndall Skelton, Rebecca Nance


## Samples
Genomic DNA was isolated from 4 affected males and 4 carrier females from the Springer Spaniel Duchenne-Like Muscular Dystrophy dog colony in Dr. Bruce F. Smith's lab at the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine. Samples were sequenced as 150bp paired-end reads using the NovaSeq 6000 platform with ~30x coverage at HudsonAlpha Discovery in Huntsville, AL.
