### This folder contains the coverage summaries and flagstat outputs from step 2 of the project.
#### Summary Statistics:
Genome Size: 2,312,802,198

| SRA ID | Percent Mapped | Average Depth | Number Reads Passed | Number Reads Mapped | Standard Deviation | Coverage |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |

| SRR8541910 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| SRR8541914 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### Calculating Coverage:
SRR8541909 = ( read count * read length ) / 2,312,802,198 = 

SRR8541910 = ( read count * read length ) / 2,312,802,198 =

SRR8541914 = ( read count * read length ) / 2,312,802,198 =
