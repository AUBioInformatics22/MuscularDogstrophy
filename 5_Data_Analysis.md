## Step 5: Data Analysis

### Overview
We manually inspected these variants within IGV and their location in the gene. The annotated reference file (canFam6.chrX.json) was loaded into IGV along with the VCF file containing the SNPs of interest (all_samples_SNPs.vcf.gz). This varint file contains SNPs on the X chromosome that are hemizygous in all affected males and heterozygous in all carrier females.
